# Letter Unlock Order & Costs

This document defines the planned order in which letters become available to each building family and the King's Point cost to unlock them. Every building tracks its own progress pointer, so you can prioritize certain structures. The sequence is designed to introduce letters from the home row outward for ergonomic learning.

## Global Unlock Sequence

| Stage | Letters Unlocked | Cost (King's Points) |
|------:|-----------------|---------------------:|
| 0 | `f`, `j` | 0 |
| 1 | `d`, `k` | 20 |
| 2 | `s`, `l` | 40 |
| 3 | `a` | 60 |
| 4 | `g`, `h` | 90 |
| 5 | `q`, `p` | 120 |
| 6 | `e`, `i` | 150 |
| 7 | `r`, `u` | 180 |
| 8 | `t`, `y` | 210 |
| 9 | `w`, `o` | 240 |
|10 | `c`, `m` | 270 |
|11 | `v`, `n` | 310 |
|12 | `x`, `z` | 350 |

Costs increase roughly every stage to encourage planning and resource management. Later stages may be gated behind additional tech-tree requirements.

## Building Families

All building families (Gathering, Military, Craft & Defense, Economy, Spiritual, Housing) follow this sequence. Because each building stores its own unlock pointer, you might have a Farmer with access up to stage 5 while your Barracks is still at stage 2. Future iterations may diverge per family, but this baseline keeps early progression simple.
