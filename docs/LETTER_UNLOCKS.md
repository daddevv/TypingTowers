# Letter Unlock Progression

Reload prompts begin with only **F** and **J**. After each wave, new letters become available in the following order:

1. **F J** – starting home row index fingers
2. **D K** – remaining index fingers
3. **S L** – middle fingers
4. **A** – ring finger
5. **G H** – inner index letters
6. **Q P** – pinky top row
7. **E I** – middle top row
8. **R U** – inner index top row
9. **T Y** – outer index top row
10. **W O** – ring/pinky top row
11. **C M** – bottom row center
12. **V N** – bottom row index
13. **X Z** – bottom row outside

Additional waves after the final stage continue using the full unlocked pool. Future upgrades may allow purchasing letter unlocks directly from the shop instead of relying solely on wave progression.

## Tech Tree System

The letter unlock sequence is now driven by a simple technology tree. Each wave unlocks the next node, adding its letters to the global pool and granting an achievement. This provides a foundation for more advanced tech upgrades in the future.
