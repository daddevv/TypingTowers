## Core Gameplay Loop (Next Sprint)

### 1. Multiple Tower Placement & Basic Management

- [ ] **Backend:** Implement logic to place new towers on the grid using mouse clicks.
  - [ ] Define valid placement areas (e.g., specific tile types).
  - [ ] Add a cost for building new towers (`TowerConstructionCost`).
  - [ ] Deduct gold when a tower is placed.
- [ ] **UI:** Visual indicator for valid/invalid tower placement locations (e.g., highlight tile green/red).
- [ ] **UI:** Simple tower selection mechanism (e.g., clicking on a tower makes it the "active" tower for upgrades).
- [ ] **Config:** Add `TowerConstructionCost` to `config.json`.

### 2. Enhanced Shop Functionality (for Selected Tower)

- [ ] **Backend:** Modify upgrade logic to apply to the currently *selected* tower.
- [ ] **UI:** Update HUD to clearly show which tower is selected (if any).
- [ ] **UI:** Shop upgrade options (1,2,3,4 keys) should affect the selected tower.
- [ ] **Feature:** "Foresight" upgrade (from old TODO):
  - [ ] **Backend:** Increase the number of reload queue letters shown.
  - [ ] **UI:** Update HUD to display more reload queue letters.
  - [ ] **Shop:** Add "Foresight" as a purchasable upgrade (e.g., key '5').
- [ ] **UI:** Create basic upgrade UI with keyboard navigation (placeholder for full visual overhaul).
- [ ] **UI:** Add visual feedback for purchased upgrades (e.g., updated stats display in HUD/Shop UI).

## Advanced Mechanics & Systems (Following Sprints)

### Word-Based Reloading

- [ ] Design: Define short words for reloading (e.g., "ammo", "load", "zap").
- [ ] Implement: Replace single-letter reload prompts with word prompts.
- [ ] Implement: Logic for typing words correctly for reload.
- [ ] UI: Update HUD to display word prompts.

### Typing Performance Modifiers

- [ ] Track typing accuracy for reloads/targeting.
- [ ] Track typing speed (WPM or similar metric).
- [ ] Implement: Reload speed bonuses for fast/accurate typing.
- [ ] Implement: Penalties for slow/inaccurate typing (e.g., increased reload time, temporary jam).
- [ ] UI: Display basic typing stats (accuracy, WPM) in HUD.

### Letter Pool Progression

- [ ] Design: System for unlocking/expanding available letters for reloading (e.g., start with f and j, proceed to other index fingers, then middle then ring then pinky, unlock more via shop or wave progression).
- [ ] Implement: Mechanism to expand the letter pool.

## Medium Priority (Next Month)

### Additional Tower Types

- [ ] Design sniper tower (high damage, slow fire, precise typing)
- [ ] Design rapid-fire tower (low damage, fast fire, simple inputs)
- [ ] Implement tower type selection in shop/build menu
- [ ] Balance different tower types for strategic variety

### Enhanced Enemy Variety

- [ ] Create different enemy types with varying health/speed
- [ ] Add special enemies that require specific letter combinations or words
- [ ] Implement enemy abilities (e.g., armor, shields, speed bursts)
- [ ] Design boss enemies for milestone waves

### Typing Performance Metrics (Full Integration)

- [ ] Implement performance-based score multipliers for gold/score.
- [ ] Add detailed typing statistics page/summary post-game.
- [ ] Create performance history tracking (e.g., best WPM, accuracy trends).

## Low Priority (Future Releases)

### Progressive Letter Unlocks (Tech Tree)

- [ ] Design tech tree for unlocking new letters, words, or typing abilities.
- [ ] Implement letter/word unlock conditions and rewards.
- [ ] Create visual tech tree interface.
- [ ] Add achievement system for unlock milestones.

### Advanced Reload Mechanics

- [ ] Implement variable reload sequences based on tower type or upgrades.
- [ ] Add combo system for consecutive accurate inputs during reload/targeting.
- [ ] Create special reload challenges for bonus effects.

### Quality of Life Improvements

- [ ] Add pause menu with options (resume, restart, quit, settings).
- [ ] Implement save/load game state.
- [ ] Create settings menu for key bindings, audio, and display options.
- [ ] Add sound effects and background music.

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Refactor tower creation to support multiple tower types efficiently.
- [ ] Abstract enemy creation for different enemy types and behaviors.
- [ ] Improve configuration system for more complex parameters (e.g., per-tower type configs, enemy-specific letter pools).
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging for edge cases.
- [ ] Implement a more robust asset management system.

## Testing

- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for new systems:
  - [ ] Letter-based enemy targeting logic.
  - [ ] Multiple tower placement, selection, and gold deduction.
  - [ ] Shop upgrades for selected towers.
  - [ ] Word-based reloading.
- [ ] Add integration tests for complex interactions (e.g., multiple towers targeting, shop affecting game state).
- [ ] Performance optimization for large numbers of entities.

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Create gameplay tutorial/guide for new mechanics (targeting, tower placement).
- [ ] Document new configuration file parameters (`TowerConstructionCost`, letter pools, etc.).
- [ ] Update developer setup instructions if new dependencies or build steps arise.
- [ ] Update contribution guidelines for new features and testing requirements.
- [ ] Code cleanup and documentation updates within the codebase.
