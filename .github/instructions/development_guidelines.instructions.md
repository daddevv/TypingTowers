# Development Guidelines

- Format Go code using `gofmt` before committing.
- Run `go vet` and `go test ./...` in the `v1` directory to catch issues early.
- Keep functions small and well documented with comments.
- When adding features, write unit tests first when possible.
- Include descriptive commit messages summarizing the change.
- Update documentation and instructions whenever project layout or build steps change.
