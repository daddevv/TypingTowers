# Backlog Management Prompt

## Objective
Summarize completed TODOs, remove them from the list, and then reorganize, condense, and fill in any gaps as if you are the project manager.

## Instructions
- Review the current `TODO.md` file.
- Summarize all completed tasks (checked items) in a separate `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- Remove completed tasks from the main TODO list to keep it focused and actionable.
- Reorganize the remaining tasks for clarity and logical grouping. Condense similar or redundant items.
- Identify and fill in any gaps or missing steps in the TODOs, ensuring the list is comprehensive and actionable for the team.
- Use your judgment as a project manager to prioritize, clarify, and structure the backlog for maximum productivity.
- Ensure the updated TODO list is clear, concise, and easy to follow for all contributors.
- Do not remove or alter any tasks that are still in progress or not yet started.
- If you encounter ambiguity, use the project layout and documentation as a guide.
- Ensure that the final TODO list is well-organized and easy to understand for all team members.
- Ensure the README.md and project layout documentation are up-to-date with any changes made to/from the TODO list.
