## Core Gameplay Loop Demo (Highest Priority)

- [x] **CORE-DEMO** Achieve a working demo of the core gameplay loop:
  - [x] Farmer and Barracks buildings enqueue words to the global queue
  - [x] Typing words processes queue, produces resources, and spawns units
  - [x] Shared queue manager with jam/back-pressure mechanics
  - [x] Per-building cooldowns and letter unlocks
  - [x] HUD displays queue, cooldowns, and resources
  - [x] Basic enemy waves and base HP system
  - [x] End-to-end test: survive 5+ waves with resource/typing feedback

---

  - [x] `/` to enter tower selection mode, letter labels, upgrade menu
- [x] **CMD-001** Command mode for power users
  - [x] `:` to enter command mode, basic and advanced commands
- [x] **TITLE-001** Title screen and main menu
