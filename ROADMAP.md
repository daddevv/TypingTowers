## Core Gameplay Loop Demo (Highest Priority)

- [x] **CORE-DEMO** Achieve a working demo of the core gameplay loop:
  - [x] Farmer and Barracks buildings enqueue words to the global queue
  - [x] Typing words processes queue, produces resources, and spawns units
  - [x] Shared queue manager with jam/back-pressure mechanics
  - [x] Per-building cooldowns and letter unlocks
  - [x] HUD displays queue, cooldowns, and resources
  - [x] Basic enemy waves and base HP system
  - [x] End-to-end test: survive 5+ waves with resource/typing feedback

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Post-Demo Polish)

- [x] **QUEUE-001** Letter-by-letter queue processing
  - [x] Adjust backlog pressure for letter queues
  - [x] Static word processing location at (400, 900) with conveyor effect
- [x] **UI-001** Tower selection and upgrade system
  - [x] `/` to enter tower selection mode, letter labels, upgrade menu
- [ ] **CMD-001** Command mode for power users
  - [ ] `:` to enter command mode, basic and advanced commands
- [x] **TITLE-001** Title screen and main menu
  - [x] MainMenuState, logo, background music, animated background, settings
- [x] **PREGAME-001** Pre-game setup and tutorial
  - [x] Character/difficulty selection, tutorial, typing test, mode selection
