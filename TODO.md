# TODO: TypeDefense Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for TypeDefense. The core game loop is now feature-complete and fun, with a robust typing mechanic, projectile system, and dynamic difficulty scaling. The focus has shifted to content expansion, polish, and additional game modes.

## Current Status: Core Game Loop Complete ✅

The single-mob iteration phase is complete with a fully functional typing-based tower defense game featuring:

- ✅ Responsive typing mechanics with immediate visual feedback
- ✅ Projectile system with collision detection and visual effects  
- ✅ Dynamic mob spawning with difficulty scaling
- ✅ Score-based progression with expanding letter pools
- ✅ Performance-optimized rendering with letter image caching
- ✅ Smooth 100 TPS game loop with parallel mob updates
